## ðŸ“£ What does this dbt package do?
This package models Workday HCM data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/workday-hcm).  

The main focus of the Workday HCM package is to transform the core object tables into analytics-ready models:

<!--section="workday_model"-->
- Materializes [Workday HCM staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_workday/#!/overview/workday/models/?g_v=1) which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/workday-hcm/#schemainformation). 
- The staging tables clean, test, and prepare your Workday HCM data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/workday-hcm) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Primary keys are renamed from `id` to `<table name>_id`. 
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
  - Provides insight into your Workday HCM data by creating the final end models for further transformation and analysis:
  
| **model**                 | **description**                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [workday__employee_overview](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_workday/#!/model/model.workday.workday__employee_overview)  | Each record represents an employee with enriched personal information and the positions they hold. This helps measure employee demographic and geographical distribution, overall retention and turnover, and compensation analysis of their employees. |
| [workday__job_overview](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_workday/#!/model/model.workday.workday__job_overview)  | Each record represents a job with enriched details on job profiles and job families. This allows users to understand recruitment patterns and details within a job and job groupings. |
| [workday__organization_overview](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_workday/#!/model/model.workday.workday__organization_overview) |  Each record represents organization, organization roles, as well as positions and workers tied to these organizations. This allows end users to slice organizational data at any grain to better analyze organizational structures.  |
| [workday__position_overview](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_workday/#!/model/model.workday.workday__position_overview) | Each record represents a position with enriched data on positions. This allows end users to understand position availabilities, vacancies, cost to optimize hiring efforts. |
